### About Me
Hi there! My name is Olivia, but you can call me Liv. I am a rising fourth-year student at the University of Virginia pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics. I am so incredibly passionate about problem-solving and driven by my pure admiration and love for software engineering. Back-end development is where I see myself truly thriving, although my interest in full-stack continues to grow! Using my skills in data science to utilize adept information gathering, analysis, and assessment tactics in a collaborative fashion with my skills in software development has been especially meaningful to my interests in the field and something I strive to improve upon in the future. Welcome to my profile!
